# Product Mission

## Problem

Organizations struggle with multiple interconnected challenges around feature requests and business needs:

- **Internal process inefficiency** — Teams deal with manual processes, scattered requests across email/Slack/docs, and lack of visibility into what's been requested
- **Customer feedback collection** — Difficulty gathering and systematically prioritizing customer feature requests
- **Cross-team collaboration** — Teams can't easily share, track, or vote on ideas across the organization, leading to siloed decision-making
- **Feature prioritization** — Hard to decide what to build next based on actual demand rather than gut feeling

## Target Users

- **Product managers and product teams** — Who need to collect, prioritize, and track feature requests from multiple sources
- **Internal employees** — Staff within an organization submitting business requests and feature ideas

## Solution

A lightweight, collaborative platform that brings clarity to feature prioritization through:

- **Voting system** — Democratic prioritization through upvotes and likes from stakeholders, surfacing the highest-impact requests
- **Admin workflow** — Structured approval process with status tracking and activity logs for accountability
- **Visual roadmap** — Kanban-style roadmap view to communicate what's planned and in progress
- **Simplicity** — Easy to use, lightweight alternative to complex tools like Jira or Productboard
- **Collaboration** — Enables different users to align on the highest-priority problems through transparent discussion
- **Clear visibility** — Everyone can see request status, votes, and progress at a glance
- **Request-to-roadmap linking** — Connect approved requests directly to roadmap items
- **Automations** — Streamline workflows and reduce manual status updates
